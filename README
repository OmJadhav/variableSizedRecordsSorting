PROJECT 1A : SORTING WITH VARIABLE-SIZED RECORDS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

key features of the program :
  a) Used qsort() function to sort 
  b) Made only two read calls to read the complete file
  c) used record data pointer structures for sorting purposes, which eliminated
     data swaps.
  d) used one write call per record.
  

PROJECT 1B : XV6 INTRO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  a) watched videos to undestand the complete flow of systems calls from user 
     space to kernel space and back to user space.
  b) played around with XV6 code base
  c) Implemented both System call int getnumsyscallp(void)
     and user level application (syscallptest N) to test it.
  d) used getpid() system call for testing purpose
